This is a small text-based game which runs on the console, navigation is done through numbers and strings indicate don the menu.

THe rpg system is very, VERY basic and will probably go through several changes.

Right now, the only way to play this is by building this project locally (Visual Studio is the easiest way of doing this), but I will soon provide
pre-release builds for testing on github.

List of features:

(DONE)
1. Basic rpg stats and derivated stats (will probably change later).
2. Complex menu navigation with minimal hassle.
3. Partial Character creation system.
4. Character sheet banner with progress bar representing progress torwards the next level.
5. Abilitiy to create multiple characters with personalize name, bio and job.
6. Ability to select a character to start a new game.
7. Detailed character and monster stats sheet.
8. Ability to generate random monster (all normal creatures in this game will be procedurally generated).
9. Ability to create a placehiolder character for faster testing.
10. Placeholder debug mode (no use as of now).

( PLANNED FEATURES - Those will probably be implemented though not necessarily in this order )
(If I manage to do this, the game should be ready for proper release and beta testing)
1. Ability to save characters in JSON files.
2. Create a "monsterpedia" of all the monsters you have encountered.
3. Basic combat system.
4. Simple looting system (to be improved later)
5. Inventory system.
6. Merchants and using gold.
7. Basic items and equipments.
8. Basic item and equipment looting.
9. Complex diablo-like items.
10. Complex diablo-like loot grind.
11. Dungeon navigation system.
12. Premade dungeon as placeholder.
13. Dungeon looting system (ex. chests)
14. Dungeon dangers (traps)
15. Named monsters generation system.
16. Implement Bosses.
17. Procedurally generated dungeons.
18. Statuses and effects.
19. Magic and spells.

(POSSIBLE FEATURES - Those may be done after)
1. Implement a proper tabletop rpg system, currently considering Paizo´s ORC or the OpenRPG (this has been implemented in C++ but could be plausibly adapted into C#).
(though I must say that i dislike d20 systems, I will look into it.)
