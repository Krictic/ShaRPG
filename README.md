#ShaRPG

Note on archiving:

This was my first real attempt at building a project in C# utilizing OOP and SOLID principles. It was a failure, at some point I had decided to refactor this into a Move-Controller-View design, and this, too, has failed, and failed in an way that I cannot recover from, its not that it cannto be fixed, its that *I* cannot for now, so iI will leave this as an archive for myself.

What now? Well, im oint o start again, taking the lessons from this failure I will start from scratch and use code snippets from this cade (because nto everything here is a essentially bad idea). Look forward for my next project. Im thinking about calling it... ShaRPer! OR something silly along those lines.

Thank you.

Introduction:

This is a small text-based game which runs on the console, navigation is done through numbers and strings indicate on the menu. (I do plan on changing that).

This wass made at first, with the help of the icnredible (albeit incomplete) tutorial by Suraj Sharmar:

With this tutorial iÂ´ve finally started to unerstand hwo OOP projects actually work from a pragmatic perspective instead of merely theoretical
and despite a few shortcomings, it was generally a great series to teach me the ropes.

Description:

THe rpg system is very, VERY basic and will probably go through several changes.

Right now, the only way to play this is by building this project locally (Visual Studio is the easiest way of doing this), but I will soon provide
pre-release builds for testing on github.
