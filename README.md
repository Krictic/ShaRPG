#ShaRPG

Introduction:

This is a small text-based game which runs on the console, navigation is done through numbers and strings indicate on the menu. (I do plan on changing that).

This wass made at first, with the help of the icnredible (albeit incomplete) tutorial by Suraj Sharmar:

With this tutorial iÂ´ve finally started to unerstand hwo OOP projects actually work from a pragmatic perspective instead of merely theoretical
and despite a few shortcomings, it was generally a great series to teach me the ropes.

Description:

THe rpg system is very, VERY basic and will probably go through several changes.

Right now, the only way to play this is by building this project locally (Visual Studio is the easiest way of doing this), but I will soon provide
pre-release builds for testing on github.

Warning:

There is a slight memory leak with the chraacter creator and creature generator, its not much, about 5 mb, nothing to be too worried about.
I intend on correcting it once I learn to appease de Garbage Collection Gods.

Thank you.
